This file is notes about how to change the html we get

1. for each video page, we need to search for KEYWORD "rioplayer" first

2. then we can find source url link next to string rioplayer

3. for video url link, we need to get rid of double quotes and "amp;", and save "&"

4. for video(link) name, we can search "video_title", then pass the value to video title to link name
