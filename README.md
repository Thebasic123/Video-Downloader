# Video-Downloader
find video url links from a poker training site I subscribed, I need to simulate log-in, and crawl the video pages only 

This project uses python crawler to search for correct url links in a poker training site which called Run It Once

since we can easily use wget to download videos if we have url link, so I only get url 
links in this project. There are too many videos, download all of them won't be pratical
